C++ Ray Tracer
=============================

Written By: Joey Hong

This is a simple ray tracer build using C++, following the CS11
Advanced C++ Track
(http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/advcpp/index.html)

The Google C++ Testing Framework and Boost Library were used in this
program.

-----------------------------

The main program can be compiled with 'make' but not the test
programs, which must be done separately:

*tests/test_Color.cc
*tests/test_Vector3F.cc

In the Makefile, please first add the path to your own Boost Library.

To run the program, type in the bash either:

./rt < input.txt > output.png OR
           
./rt -f input.txt > output.png

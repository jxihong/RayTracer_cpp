=============================

Written By: Joey Hong                                                               

This is a simple ray tracer build using C++, following the CS11 Advanced C++ Track          
(http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/advcpp/index.html)                  

The Google C++ Testing Framework and Boost Library were used in this program.     

-----------------------------

The main program can be compiled with 'make' but not the test programs. In the      
Makefile, please first add the path to your own Boost Library.
